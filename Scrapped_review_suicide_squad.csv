0,The thing that makes The Suicide Squad so singularly distasteful is closely related to its factory-installed cynicism: the unconscionable glibness that grows out of it.
1,"'The Suicide Squad' represents the very best that DC films can be, taking the kind of risks that you wouldn't see in a Marvel property."
2,"If there was even an iota of human emotion evident the movie would be unbearable as well as increasingly vile. But there isn't, so instead it's just kind of exhausting..."
3,"If the ham-fisted glut of multi-million dollar special effects don't dazzle you, then the calibre of The Suicide Squad's genuinely impressive ensemble cast by all rights should."
4,"The movie is too much, too long, but not lacking in its glories. To find them, follow Harley. She's leading the way."
5,"With The Suicide Squad, Gunn shows that there are ways to keep things edgy while at the same time offering enough humor and action to maintain the crowd-pleasing elements."
6,"This is one sick, totally fun blast,"
7,"Stunning, bloody, strange and very entertaining despite all its hokum."
8,"The Suicide Squad is much better than its predecessor (it was not difficult to improve it). James Gunn's hand is very noticeable, offering us a fun movie with a fantastic soundtrack and blood, lots of blood. [Full review in Spanish]"
9,"The Suicide Squad is a magnificent blend of gore, heart, and humor that engages its audience instantly with strong characters, performances, and breathtaking visuals."
10,I had a great time with this movie.
11,"It can't stop nudging the audience about how ridiculous all of this is; the opening reel is essentially a series of eye-rolls about the film's own preposterousness, with the audience flattered at being in on the joke."

22,"Definitely a movie worth watching and enjoying. In so many ways, The Suicide Squad' lives up to its name, but I am starting to see the formulaic nature of superhero movies, which is worrisome."
23,Imagine if Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool had some horribly beautiful baby.
